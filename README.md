## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Lyster Kwamboka!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently perfecting my skills by exploring  data, building predictive models and  sustainability strategies through data.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced machine learning techniques, deep learning with TensorFlow, and real-world applications of AI.  
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source data science projects, especially in healthcare, aviation, or environmental sustainability.  
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with mastering deployment techniques for ML models and learning more about deep neural networks.  
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about data cleaning, storytelling with data, or how I use Python libraries to uncover insights.  
ðŸ“« You van reach me via linkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/lysterkwamboka | Email: kwambokalyster20@gmail.com 

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her  
âš¡Fun Fact: Machine learning models may get all the glory, but without clean data, theyâ€™re just fancy guesses in a lab coat.
